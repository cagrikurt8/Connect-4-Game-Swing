Connect 4 Game Implemented with Swing

The game places the labels starting from the most bottom of each column when one clicks the columns. If four labels which can be "X" or "O" are connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the game ends and the player who accomplishes to connect 4 pieces wins the game.
